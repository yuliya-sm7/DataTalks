--- Question 3. Count records
--- How many taxi trips were totally made on January 15?
SELECT count(*) 
FROM "green_tripdata_2019-01"
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime::DATE = '2019-01-15' 
AND lpep_dropoff_datetime::DATE = '2019-01-15';

--- Question 4. Largest trip for each day
--- Which was the day with the largest trip distance Use the pick up time for your calculations.
SELECT lpep_pickup_datetime
FROM "green_tripdata_2019-01"
ORDER BY trip_distance DESC
LIMIT 1;

--- Question 5. The number of passengers
--- In 2019-01-01 how many trips had 2 and 3 passengers?
SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN passenger_count = 2 THEN 1 END) AS passengers2,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN passenger_count = 3 THEN 1 END) AS passengers3
FROM "green_tripdata_2019-01"
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime::DATE = '2019-01-01';

--- Question 6. Largest tip
--- For the passengers picked up in the Astoria Zone which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? We want the name of the zone, not the id.
SELECT
  tip_amount,
  dr."Zone"
FROM "green_tripdata_2019-01" AS a
JOIN "taxi+_zone_lookup" AS dr
ON a."DOLocationID" = dr."LocationID"
JOIN "taxi+_zone_lookup" AS pi
ON a."PULocationID" = pi."LocationID"
WHERE pi."Zone" = 'Astoria'
ORDER BY tip_amount DESC
LIMIT 1;
